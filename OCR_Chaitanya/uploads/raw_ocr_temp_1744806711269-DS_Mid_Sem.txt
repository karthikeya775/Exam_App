1. (a) | Take the following list of functions and arrange them in ascending order of growth rate. That is, i

function g(n) immediately follows function f(n) inyour list, then it should be the case that f(71) is

O(g(n)). Write your answer with proper explanation:

h(a) = 2v9", fy) = 20, fxn) on /s, fy(n) = n!99", fg(n) = 2?
(b) Measure the step counts for all 4 statements in (he following program segment to determine the overall | 5
asymptotic upper bound on the running time of the given program segment.

Consider a doubly linked list in which only the f

(i) Insert a new node in the given doubly linked list which is already sorted in ascending order of I.
the key values stored in its nodes such a manner that after the insertion the sorted order must be SN ig
retained as it is. aa 4

(ii) Append a new doubly linked list in which only the last node (right most) is pointed by a header
pointer db_tail at the end of the given doubly linked list.

(b) | Suppose that each row of an 7 x n array A consists of I's and 0's such that, in any row of A, all the 1's | 3
come before any 0's in that row. Assuming A is already in memory, write an algorithm running in OC)
time for finding the row of A that contains the most 1

You are given an array Arr|1:n] representing a min-heap and an integer ¢ You have to design an | 5
algorithm to output al] the keys in the array that are less than ¢. For example, if ¢ = 9 and the array Arr
is as shown below, then your algorithm should output the keys 4, 6, and 7. Note that the time complexity
of the designed algorithm should be O(k), where k be the number of keys in Arr that are smaller than ¢.

Now, consider the queue data structure with two supporting operations: enqueuer and dequeue, Suppose
that for the above sequence, each letter (such as M) corresponds. to an enqueue operation of that letter on |
