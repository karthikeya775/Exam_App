Attempt all questions. Write full justifications for your answers to be evaluated.
1. Consider the following language over the alphabet. © = {0, 1}
L= {w € d*|w starts with 10 but does not end with 10}

(a) Write a regular expression for L (5)
(b) Design a DFA for L (7)

2. (a) Convert the following NFA to an equivalent DFA using the subset-construction
procedure (No marks shall be awarded for using any other method). Clearly describe
all the steps (partial reasoning is not acceptable). Draw the state-transition diagram
of the DFA with all the possible states. Write all unreachable states (that is, states
inaccessible from the start state) in your DFA. Consider {0,1} as your input alphabet. (8)

Show all the possible state sequences if we run the NFA M on the string 0110110.
From the state sequences decide whether the string is in L(M). (4)

3. Consider the following grammars. Describe the languages denoted by them. If a language
is not regular then prove it using pumping lemma otherwise write the regular expression
for the language (Marks will be deducted for fallacious and incomplete reasoning).

5. Answer the following questions

(a) Use the slot-filling algorithm to minimize the DFA. Show the table construction (Use
of any other algorithm will induce zero marks). For each distinguishable state-pair
clearly state why you find them distinguishable. Draw the minimized DFA. (6)

(b) Find the regular expression for the DFA using the state elimination algorithm. No
marks shall be awarded for using any other method. (6)
