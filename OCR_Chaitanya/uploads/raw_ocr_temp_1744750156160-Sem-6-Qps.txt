Question Marks

Consider the following bit stream that has been encoded using VRC, LRC and even parity. 3
Locate the error if present and re-write the complete bit stream (after correction, if any) :

11000011 11110011 1049010 00001010 +~=—«-00101011 +—:00101011 10100011
00101011

w) Draw the Differential Manchester Encoding for the given NRZ-I signal: 2

(c) | We need a three-stage space-division switch with N=100. We use 10 crossbars at the first and 5
third stages-and 4 crossbars at the middle stage. Draw the complete layout (configuration) of

such a switch [Atleast show all connections between crossbars no 1, 2 and 10 of stage 1 &
stage 3 through stage 2] and respond to the following question:
7 Calculate the total number of cross points.

(ii) Find the possible number of simultaneous connections.
(iii) Find the possible number of simultaneous connections if we use a single crossbar (100 x
100).
Find the blocking factor with respect to part (ii) and (iii).
Plot a composite signal (in time-domain) having following components (i to iii): | 3
(i) A periodic signal having Amplitude: 15 volts and Frequency: 0 Hz.
| GiA periodic signal having Amplitude: 10 volts and Frequency: 4 Hz
| (iii)A periodic signal having Amplitude: 5 volts, Frequency: 4 Hz and Phase: 90°
Also plot a frequency-domain representation of a composite signal having only first two

components (i & ii).
a The loss in a cable is usually defined in decibels per kilometer (dB/km). If the signal at the 2
beginning of a cable with - 0.3 dB/km has a power of 2mW, what is the power of the signal at
5km? 19ers : :
(c) | What is a pulse stuffing TDM? Two channels, one with a bit rate of 190 kbps and another with 5
a bit rate 180 kbps are to be multiplexed using pulse stuffing TDM with no synchronization
bits.
Answer the following questions:
@ What is the size of a frame in bits?
(ii) What is the frame rate?
(iii) What is the duration of a frame?
|__| Gv) What is the date rate? __|
